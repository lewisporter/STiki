/**
 * Andrew G. West - db_off_edits.java - This class performs all DB functions
 * that pertain to the deletion/update/insertion of offending edits. Crucially,
 * SELECT queries run over this data are handled by the reputation module.
 * <p/>
 * Offending edits include bad-edits identified by any mechanism. This
 * includes both (1) rollback-edits, as are found by automatically parsing
 * edit comments, and (2) feedback provided at the STiki front-end.
 * <p/>
 * Note that many methods are synchronized, preventing their simultaneous
 * execution. Such mutual exclusion is not always necessary (e.g., one could
 * query article and user OEs simultaneously). However, this Java mutex is of
 * little significance given that these statements share a MySQL connection,
 * and therefore some form of mutex is being applied at the server.
