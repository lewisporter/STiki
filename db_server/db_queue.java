/**
 * Andrew G. West - db_queue.java - This class performs all DB functions
 * pertaining to a queue table -- which is a table containing RIDs that
 * NEED TO BE CLASSIFIED by a human, with the following criteria:
 * <p/>
 * [1]: This table shall not contain edits that have been classified
 * by a human. Once an edit has been classified, it should be
 * deleted from this table, and the details of that classification
 * should be written into table [feedback].
 * [2]: This table should contain only edits which are the 'most recent'
 * edit on the page they were made. If an edit does not meet this
 * criteria, it should be deleted from the table.
 * <p/>
 * Note that this "server-side" portion of database access is concerned
 * primarily with queue additions and maintenance. The queue is also a focal
 * point for client-side action, conducted through the client interface.
 * <p/>
 * Note that this handler encompasses MULTIPLE tables. Given the inclusion
 * of multiple edit queues, this handles all [queue_*] tables. The
 * specific table an instance handles is determined at construction.
